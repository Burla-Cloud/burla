### How to run the tests

These steps assume you're already a contributer with a Google Cloud Project prepared with the required resources to run a burla cluster.  
Email `jake@burla.dev` if you're interested in contributing, or just [put time on my calendar](https://cal.com/jakez/burla?duration=30) :)   

&nbsp;

1. Start a cluster:
    - run `make local-dev-cluster` (runs entire cluster on your local machine)
    - OR: run `make remote-dev-cluster` (main_service runs locally, nodes run in the cloud)
2. Run `make test`

If running in `local-dev-mode` errors will be visible in docker desktop container logs.  
If running in `remote-dev-mode` errors will be visible in the terminal where the `main_service`
is running, or google-cloud-logging for errors in the `node_service` or `container_service`.
